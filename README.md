Login Page: 
Login Page is very common among any type of secured applications and its widely used on the internet for authenticating the user before presenting the secured pages of the web applications. For example to use Facebook you have to get authenticated by the Facebook before they give you access to their platform. The user authentication is done through a special web page called Login Page. The Login page asks you to enter your credentials which is then validated by the application and after successful validation you are presented with the secured part of the application.
 login page will validate you to find if you are the authenticated user  or not. If not you won't be able and can't access it. 
 The security and authentication of any application is very old process .
 
 
 If you are learning HTML form then this can be your first and easy way  of making a simple login form and validating it using HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS. In this  we have developed a simple login form for beginners. This teaches you to create simple login form in HTML.
Our login page displays following component on the page:

1. Input text for entering user  name

2. Input text for entering password

3. Login button to submit form data to the server side program. In this example we are not writing any server side program for validating it with database. If you want to validate the user with database you can write any of the server side programs such as JSP, Servlet or PHP to validate the user against database. In the bottom of this tutorial we will provide you link to learn more about validating the user against database.

What is the use of Login Page?

Similarly in Android and iOS applications login page/form is used to validate the user with the system before access is given to the user. 
So, there are various types of login page to meet the specific requirement of the applications.
Many companies are designing the login page in very unique way to make their application very attractive.
Here we are going to explore the Login Form/Login Page used in the applications.

How Login Form is developed?
Login form is simple HTML Form element with one input for username and other input for password. 
There are two buttons one for submitting the form and other for reset of the form. 
There might be links for forgot password and register new account. With these elements complete Login form is developed.
In case native applications such as Android or iOS login form is developed using the native code and it becomes integral part of the application. 
But the logic of the Login and validation remains the same. Here also Login form calls the back-end server-side application for validating the users.

this project is all bout the creation and deployment of the login page which is very basic for any application.
this code might be useful for your various applications.
